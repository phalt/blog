## Django API Styleguide
**2019**

The accumulation of years working with Django in high-growth companies, this styleguide emphasises pragmatic decisions for scaling the number of developers you can have working in a project, and making it easy to refactor and split it into micro-projects in the future.

## Beckett HTTP Client
**2016**

A convention-based tool for building API clients around HTTP APIs.

Mostly an experiment with the following hypothesis:

_"If we all built truly RESTful APIs, could we autogenerate clients for them?"_

## SWAPI - the Star Wars API
**2014-ongoing**

Following in the fashion of PokéAPI, SWAPI provides structured data about the Star Wars films - characters, planets, star ships, etc.

Has been used in many examples of good API design around the world, and the official [graphQL](https://graphql.org) documentation even makes their own graphQL-version based on the data.

## PokéAPI - the Pokémon API
**2013-2018**

I created PokéAPI, the first API for Pokémon data.

Originally used Django, now generated statically hosted JSON files for the data.

Serves around 100,000 requests per day.
