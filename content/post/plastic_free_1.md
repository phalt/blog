I think I'm pretty good at avoiding disposable plastics.

I carry around a [reusable cup](https://ecoffeecup.eco/) for coffee and a [bottle](https://www.chillysbottles.com/uk) for water. I am lucky enough that I can afford to eat out most days and so I try to pick places that don't use too much plastic. [Leon](https://leon.co/) is pretty good at doing this, and their veggie food is proper tasty. Finally, we cook evening meals that can be eaten over a few days to save time and energy.

## How wrong am I?

When you are consciously trying cut down the amount of plastic you waste it is easy to notice when you make mistakes. For me this happens after we go grocery shopping: nearly all the UK highstreet supermarkets [don't give a fuck](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/17/nearly-1m-tonnes-every-year-supermarkets-shamed-for-plastic-packaging) about the amount of stuff they wrap in plastic. It's really hard to find basic things like brocolli and potatoes that aren't wrapped in something.

So I think I do a pretty good job already but I wanted to measure how much I _actually use_ in a typical week. Being a nerd; I wanted to measure this scientifically by carrying out an experiment.

I will document a week where I buy things as I have been doing, then I will try and do a plastic-free week and see how easy it is to cut down (either entirely or greatly) my plastic waste. I'll also weigh my recylcing bag at the end of the week to see if I've reduced the amount of plastics in it.

## How much plastic am I really wasting?

### Monday

I filled up my water bottle and grab a coffee on the way to work. I use my _ecoffee cup_ to avoid a disposable cup. I bought a little breakfast snack bar that toots it's own horn about it begin vegan and palm-oil free but [the wrapping is definitely plastic](https://jenksbrands.com/pages/eatcrete-nougat-bar). Ah well, it's better to cut down on a few things than to not cut down at all.

We had lunch in a restaurant because we had a new person join my work team. No plastic, and I even got the meal for free!

About two months ago I had all my wisdom teeth removed. So I've been careful about keeping my mouth clean. Today I finished a bottle of mouthwash and had to throw it away.

> Side note: I'm "that person" who goes through the office bins fixing everyone else's rubbish habits. Perfectly good cardboard in the rubbish bin just makes me sad.

I was home alone for dinner and I wanted to finish some  video game stuff so I whacked together a little pasta dish in 5 minutes, but it cost me a whole plastic box with a non-recyclable film ðŸ˜©

### Tuesday

I felt guilty about the plastic breakfast bar I had yesterday. I  grabbed a fresh muffin instead, but I couldnâ€™t find a paper bag for it. The cafe only supplied half-paper-half-plastic bags so I can oogle my  food (?!?) before I take it out of the wrapping. Totally unnecessary.

> Side note: My office supplies sparkling water in plastic bottles. By the end of the day I see stacks of empty plastic bottles on people's desks. It's tragic.

I had Leon for lunch, which means zero plastic and I can recycle most of it. Everything except the tin foil of my halloumi wrap because it was  covered in food waste. For dinner we had stir fry. We didnâ€™t have any fresh veg in the house so we got some pre-chopped in plastic. Noodles were in plastic too. I  had a package deliver with a role of bubble wrap, but it said it was  made of plants!

**Tuesday plastic**

* Plastic film bag for my breakfast muffin.
* Pre-cut vegetables in a package.
* Fresh noodles in a tub.
