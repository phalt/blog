I think I'm pretty good at avoiding disposable plastics.

## How wrong am I?

I carry around a [reusable cup](https://ecoffeecup.eco/) for coffee and a [bottle](https://www.chillysbottles.com/uk) for water. I am lucky enough that I can afford to eat out most days and so I try to pick places that don't use too much plastic. [Leon](https://leon.co/) is pretty good at doing this, and their veggie food is proper tasty. Finally, we cook evening meals that can be eaten over a few days to save time and energy.

When you are consciously trying cut down the amount of plastic you waste it is easy to notice when you make mistakes. For me this happens after we go grocery shopping: nearly all the UK highstreet supermarkets just [don't give a fuck](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/17/nearly-1m-tonnes-every-year-supermarkets-shamed-for-plastic-packaging) about the amount of stuff they wrap in plastic. It's really hard to find basic things like brocolli and potatoes that aren't wrapped in something.

So I think I do a pretty good job already but I wanted to measure how much I _actually use_ in a typical week. Being a nerd; I wanted to measure this scientifically by carrying out an experiment.

I will document a week where I buy things as I have been doing, then I will try and do a plastic-free week and see how easy it is to cut down (either entirely or greatly) my plastic waste.

## How much plastic am I really buying?

### Monday

I fill up my water bottle and grab a coffee on the way to work. I use my _ecoffee cup_ to avoid a disposable cup. I buy a little breakfast snack bar that toots it's own horn about it begin vegan and palm-oil free but [the wrapping is definitely plastic](https://jenksbrands.com/pages/eatcrete-nougat-bar). Ah well, it's better to cut down on a few things than to not cut down at all.

We had lunch in a resturant because we had a new person join my work team. No plastic, and I even got the meal for free!

About two months ago I had all my wisdom teeth removed so I've been extra careful about keeping my mouth clean. I finished a bottle of mouthwash today and had to throw it away.
