I think I'm pretty good at avoiding disposable plastics.

I carry around a [reusable cup](https://ecoffeecup.eco/) for coffee and a [bottle](https://www.chillysbottles.com/uk) for water. I am lucky enough that I can afford to eat out most days and so I try to pick places that don't use too much plastic. [Leon](https://leon.co/) is pretty good at doing this, and their veggie food is proper tasty. Finally, we cook evening meals that can be eaten over a few days to save time and energy.

## How wrong am I?

When you are consciously trying cut down the amount of plastic you waste it is easy to notice when you make mistakes. For me this happens after we go grocery shopping: nearly all the UK highstreet supermarkets [don't give a fuck](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/17/nearly-1m-tonnes-every-year-supermarkets-shamed-for-plastic-packaging) about the amount of stuff they wrap in plastic. It's really hard to find basic things like brocolli and potatoes that aren't wrapped in something.

So I think I do a pretty good job already but I wanted to measure how much I _actually use_ in a typical week. Being a nerd; I wanted to measure this scientifically by carrying out an experiment.

I will document a week where I buy things as I have been doing, then I will try and do a plastic-free week and see how easy it is to cut down (either entirely or greatly) my plastic waste.

## How much plastic am I really wasting?

### Monday

I filled up my water bottle and grab a coffee on the way to work. I use my _ecoffee cup_ to avoid a disposable cup. I bought a little breakfast snack bar that toots it's own horn about it being vegan and palm-oil free but [the wrapping is definitely plastic](https://jenksbrands.com/pages/eatcrete-nougat-bar). Ah well, it's better to cut down on a few things than to not cut down at all.

We had lunch in a restaurant because we had a new person join my work team. No plastic, and I even got the meal for free!

About two months ago I had all my wisdom teeth removed. So I've been careful about keeping my mouth clean. Today I finished a bottle of mouthwash and had to throw it away.

> Side note: I'm "that person" who goes through the office bins fixing everyone else's rubbish habits. Perfectly good cardboard in the rubbish bin just makes me sad.

I was home alone for dinner and I wanted to finish some  video game stuff so I whacked together a little pasta dish in 5 minutes, but it cost me a whole plastic box with a non-recyclable film üò©

**Monday plastics**

* One breakfast bar with plastic wrapping.
* Finished a bottle of mouthwash.
* Plastic box for pasta.

### Tuesday

I felt guilty about the plastic breakfast bar I had yesterday. I  grabbed a fresh muffin instead, but I couldn‚Äôt find a paper bag for it. The cafe only supplied half-paper-half-plastic bags so I can oogle my  food (?!?) before I take it out of the wrapping. Totally unnecessary.

> Side note: My office supplies sparkling water in plastic bottles. By the end of the day I see stacks of empty plastic bottles on people's desks. It's tragic.

I had Leon for lunch, which means zero plastic and I can recycle most of it. Everything except the tin foil of my halloumi wrap because it was  covered in food waste. For dinner we had stir fry. We didn‚Äôt have any fresh veg in the house so we got some pre-chopped in plastic. Noodles were in plastic too. I  had a package deliver with a role of bubble wrap, but it said it was  made of plants!

**Tuesday plastic**

* Plastic film bag for my breakfast muffin.
* Pre-cut vegetables in a package.
* Fresh noodles in a tub.
* Two packets of crisps.

### Wednesday

It rained today. A lot. I bought another one of those breakfast bars. They're just so tasty. I wonder if I can make something like it at home.
For lunch I ate some stuff from Eat who do an awful job with their plastic reduction.

> Side note: I set up [ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) search on my work laptop today. You can help plant trees whilst you search the internet!

We're having a pretty bad week with dinners as we didn't go shopping on Monday and we both got home late today. So we're stuck with a couple of ready-made meals, covered in plastic.

**Wednesday plastic**

* Breakfast bar.
* Mac & cheese packaging.
* Packet of crisps.
* EAT fudge bar in wrapping.
* Ready-made dinner in a plastic container.

### Thursday

I figured out the problem with plastic wrapping at the cafe. I picked up a [blondie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blondie_%28confection%29) and used a couple of napkins to wrap it in. No more plastic! I had veggie sushi for lunch from waitrose. It was a plastic nightmare. I am discovering that my plastic-free lifestyle might not be as plastic-free as I originally thought.

> Side note: I found these super tasty [chocolate covered fudge bars](https://www.buttermilk.co.uk/shop/fudge/milk-chocolate-caramel-sea-salt-fudge-bar/) that are palm oil free. They are also wrapped in paper. Guilt free indulgence.

Once again, we popped to the shops and got dinner. This time I made a mushroom & spinach spaghetti thing. Nearly all of it came in some form of plastic.

**Thursday plastic**

* Plastic case for sushi at lunch.
* Also had a few plastic wrappers for ginger and soy sauce.
* Crisps for lunch.
* Mushrooms in a wrap and box.
* Spinach in a bag.
* Spaghetti in a wrapper.

### Friday

I've noticed how bad my plastic use has been this week, and so I am torn between being a good human or changing the parameters of the experiement. I need this to be a control week, so I will go against every ethical fibre in my body and pretend like I am not tracking my plastic usage. Luckily I worked from home today. I do this at least once a week. I usually have breakfast, lunch, and dinner at home. So that should have a good hit on my plastic usage.

I got breakfast from a local caf√© - pistachio croissant and coffee. Lunch was just salad and things from what we already had in the house. For dinner, I went with my partner and her parents to a Tagine resturant. That was a really easy day.

**Friday plastic**

* I think I actually avoided buying plastic today.

### The weekend

I'm grouping Saturday and Sunday together for a good reason. This weekend I had friends and family join me for my 30th birthday party in a brewery. It was quite a hectic weekend and I struggled to keep track of what we used (plastic-wise). I know we did use a few things, but I felt like it was a very atypical weekend. For that reason, I am omitting it from my experiment. I will obviously do this for the plastic-free week in order to keep it fair.

## So what's next?

Well first things first - I definitely use more plastic than I thought.

I want to break this into about three blog posts. The next one will be analysing how I am using so much plastic, and how much that matters. Maybe I'll look at what the current average usage in the UK is versus my usage. The third post will be a record of my plastic-free week. Hopefully I can cut down my waste.

Do you try to use less plastic? Have you considered tracking a typical week to see how much you use? Let me know on [twitter](https://twitter.com/phalt_).
