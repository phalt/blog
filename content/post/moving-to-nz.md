I've spent about six years in London.

I've had a great time working with hyper-growth tech companies in telecommunications, fashion, and healthcare. I've made some incredible friends, and I even met my partner here.

I'm enjoying where I am but I feel like I'm missing out on one important opportunity in life: **living in another country**.

I wrote a really long blog post trying to justify why I am leaving and why I want to move to New Zealand, and it all felt so wrong. Like - why should I have to justify that to randomers on the internet?

So I wont.

We're moving to Aotearoa New Zealand in October 2019.

If you are a Wellington tech company looking to hire a senior software developer or lead developer then hit me up. My CV is on the main page of my website.

For those of you I know in the UK, if you want to catch up and say goodbye then let me know. I am having a leaving party and you're invited :)
