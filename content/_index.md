I love building things with Python, JS, React, and Django.

I specialise in the design and implementation of APIs services. I have created some of the most [popular](https://pokeapi.co) free APIs on [the web](https://swapi.co) which are designed to demonstrate good REST practices.

More recently I have become interested in GraphQL. I am currently contributing to the [graphene](https://graphene-python.org/) project, specifically the [graphene-django](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene-django) plugin and the [graphene 3](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene/blob/master/ROADMAP.md#graphene-3) release.

## Tech

I have extensive professional experience working with the Python and Javascript languages and a host of tools in both ecosystems (React, Redux, Jest, Enyzme, Apollo, Django, Flask, DRF, Graphene, and Pytest).

I enjoy Agile processes, Test Driven Development, and Domain Driven Design.

## Community

I was awarded "individual" membership of the [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/individual-members/) ðŸ’š
Individual members  are appointed by the DSF in recognition of their service to the Django community.

The [PokÃ©API project](https://github.com/pokeapi/) is a community of open source contributors that I started, currently receiving over 100,000 API requests a month.

## Contact

I am available for API consultancy.

 I will **soon be moving to Aotearoa New Zealand** so get in touch if you want to work with me!
