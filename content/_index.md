I'm a software / environment nerd. ðŸ’»ðŸŒ³
## Tech

I love building things with Python, JS, React, and Django.

I specialise in the design and implementation of APIs services. I have created some of the most [popular](https://pokeapi.co) free APIs on [the web](https://swapi.co) which are designed to demonstrate good REST practices.

I have extensive professional experience working with the Python and Javascript languages and a host of tools in both ecosystems (React, Redux, Jest, Enyzme, Apollo, Django, Flask, DRF, Graphene, and Pytest).

I enjoy Agile processes, Test Driven Development, and Domain Driven Design.

## Tech Community

I was awarded "individual" membership of the [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/individual-members/) ðŸ’š
Individual members  are appointed by the DSF in recognition of their service to the Django community.

The [PokÃ©API project](https://github.com/pokeapi/) is a community of open source contributors that I started, currently receiving over 100,000 API requests a month.

## Environment

I care about the environment a lot.

I try to advocate responsible eating (I'm veggie) and responsible travelling. I'm super keen about responsible purchasing and I have an almost 100% sustainable wardrobe. You'll see more of this on my blog and my twitter.


## Contact

 I will **soon be moving to Aotearoa New Zealand**!

I am on [twitter](https://twitter.com/phalt_) and my [cv is here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0atn5dc7tmazk0c/paul_hallett.pdf?dl=0).
